# Presentation template with a custom style for latex

Style settings are in `Pstyle.sty`. Most of recommendations by use are in the attached presentation: `Presentation_template.tex` as an example of use, `Presentation_template.pdf` -- a generated presentation.

Compile with **XeLatex** or **LuLatex**. This allows one to use proprietary fonts like Tahoma font.
Before compiling, add a font to your home directory or as a system font.

The presentation uses  **minted** package. It is required -shell-escape in compile flags.
Also requires **tikz** and **pgfkeys** packages.

Use the template to create your own style package.
